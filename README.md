# Structure
    src/parsers: parsers for reading raw data (jsons collected from offline, live jsons from game client)
    src/parsers/Sample.py: a sample generated by the parsers which contains the features specified in the parsers
    src/parsers/.*Frame.py: a moment in the game represented by the raw data provided for that moment
    src/features: feature generators from parsed data
    src/.*\.py: various scripts and utils for training process

# Training
1. Gather match data using `training_data_collector.py`
2. Process the match data using `training_data_processor.py`
3. Run the trainer to create a model using `trainer.py`
4. Use `live_game_processor.py` to test model in game.
